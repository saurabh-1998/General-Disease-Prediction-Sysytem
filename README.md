# General-Disease-Prediction-Sysytem
Our proposed General Disease Prediction System (GDPS) is for those who often feel reluctant to go to 
hospital or physician on minor symptoms. However, in many cases, these minor symptoms may trigger 
major health hazards. As online health advice is easily reachable, using GDPS can be a great head start 
for users. Moreover, existing online health care systems suffer from lack of reliability and accuracy. 
Herein, we propose a system that relies on guided user input. The system takes input from the user and 
provides a report of userâ€™s condition on mentioned diseases. Before doing anything we did a decent 
research on rapid escalation of Internet technology and data for which handheld devices has opened up 
new avenues for online healthcare system.
